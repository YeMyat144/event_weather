# WeatherWise üå¶Ô∏è

WeatherWise is a Streamlit web application that allows users to create events with live weather information for a specific location, track RSVPs, and get real-time countdowns to the event. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve current weather data and provides an easy way for guests to RSVP and manage the guest list.

## Features

- **Event Creation**: Set up an event by entering the event name, date, time, and location.
- **Live Weather Information**: Get real-time weather conditions (temperature, description) based on the event's location.
- **Countdown Timer**: Displays the remaining time until the event begins.
- **RSVP Management**: Guests can RSVP to the event, and the host can manage the guest list with add/remove options.
